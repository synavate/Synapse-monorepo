- The synavate core has a tonne developing in our key relationships and preparing our codebase.
- The more that we explore, the more we recognise there is to do before we can release to the Open Source community.
  
### Regardless: Beginning to transport code from experimental repositories. 
Goal: A minimal execution demonstrating the vision of Synapse as our initial product.

- Create repo and add essential minimum componenents âœ…
- Finalize codebase in Synapse repo
- Prepare GCP Deployment Environment
- Integrate code cleaning via GH Actions
- Migrate code to deployment repo
- Run minimal test suite on each service + 1 x End - End (Automate tests for deployment)
- Push code to staging
- Push code to prod
